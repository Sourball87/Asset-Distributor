## EliteBook X is FLAGSHIP

`HP EliteBook X` is **flagship** tier (same as EliteBook Ultra, X1 Carbon, Dragonfly) — **not** mainstream commercial despite sitting alongside EliteBook 6/8 in some HP line-up listings.

**Why:** Confirmed by Jay. The "X" suffix marks HP's premium consumer-crossover commercial line, priced and positioned above EliteBook 6/8. In the code FAMILY_TIER_MAP, `/elitebook\s+x\b/i` sits in the flagship block immediately after `/elitebook\s+ultra/i`.

**How to apply:** Any future tier-map edit must keep EliteBook X in flagship. The unit test `"demotes EliteBook X from close → partial (flagship vs mainstream)"` in `market-price-llm.test.ts` will fail if it accidentally moves to mainstream — treat that as a regression guard.

## SYSTEM_PROMPT and FAMILY_TIER_MAP must stay in sync

Both surfaces encode the same tier map. When one changes, the other must change in lockstep. The code guard (`applyDeterministicGuard`) only fires for FAMILY_TIER_MAP entries; the prompt only fires for entries in the SYSTEM_PROMPT text. A mismatch means the guard can't backstop model errors for that family.

## brand-tiers e2e test — partialMatch required

The brand-tiers comparison tests search by the `UNIQUE` prefix (e.g. `test_tier_1234`), but product VPNs are `test_tier_1234-CORE-VPN`. Without `&partialMatch=true`, the ILIKE is exact-match and always returns `[]`. Always include `partialMatch=true` in comparison endpoint calls within this test file.
